# BookaBand Backend

This repository contains the backend service for BookaBand, a web platform that streamlines the process of hiring musicians and bands for all types of events. The system acts as a central meeting point between artists and clients, supporting the entire booking workflowâ€”from discovery and communication to contracting, payment, and logistical coordination.

## Project Context

This backend system is developed as part of a Master's Thesis for the **Master in Software Engineering and Computer Systems at UNIR (Universidad Internacional de La Rioja)**. The project demonstrates applied knowledge in backend development, web service architecture, secure API design, and real-world platform engineering.

## Key Features

- **Musician and Band Profile Management**: Artists can create and manage professional profiles with media, descriptions, and availability.
- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Clients can discover bands using filters such as artistName, location, and availability, with support for location-based queries via the Google Places API.
- **Event Booking System**: Complete support for booking flow, including date selection, contract terms, and pricing negotiation.
- **Contract Management with Digital Signature**: Contracts between clients and musicians are generated and signed digitally for legal validity and convenience.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Secure access control using JWT and role-based permissions. Google federated authentication also supported.
- **Review and Rating System**: Clients can leave feedback and ratings for bands after events.
- **Rider Management**: Bands can define and update their technical and hospitality requirements for each event.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Integrated messaging system to enable direct communication between clients and artists during the negotiation and planning phase.
- **Notification System**: Email or in-app notifications are used to keep users informed about booking updates, messages, contract changes, and more.
